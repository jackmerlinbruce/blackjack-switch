##Â Rules to consider

Add time limit for each turn: user picks up if they don't play
The more high value cards, the longer the time
The time elapsed is modulated by the number of POWER cards
This gives other players a glimpse into what you might be carrying
And will make you want to play fast

Add multiple decks for MASSIV 1000 card pickups

Add scoring points for pickups.
Does game end when people create n amount of pickups
instead of when they have no cards left
how would this change gameplay?

Make more like a war:
offence (pickup)
defence (red jack, redirection)
deception (? can everyone see what's left in the pack ?)

Add 4 card rule pickup

Add same suit deflectors/skippers
King reverses pickup
8 skips it to the next person
Queen passes it on to the next person

Can you see the total value of
Each persons hand?
Each pickup set of cards?
The entire deck?
